        # Looking at https://hub.docker.com/_/swift, the version only tags (i.e.
        # - 5.7.3) use different Ubuntu releases. Generally we want to avoid
        # bionic as it is older then we want to deal with having to build
        # protobuf on.
        #
        # We also could use less specific tags (i.e. - 5.7), so they "float" as
        # new point release come, but to help make history/logs more clear,
        # being explicit (at the cost of having to update with point releases)
        # seems better. This should also ensure protobuf caching changes with
        # each new image incase system in the Swift image are changed/updated.
