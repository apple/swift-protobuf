name: Run Conformance Tests

# This workflow is a subset of the build.yml. It *only* try to run the
# conformance checks. It is triggered weekly on a cron to catch when new
# conformance tests are added and they don't pass.
#
# Without this workflow the new tests wouldn't be noticed until a PR was made.
#
# This workflow shares the caching logic with build.yml. It should serve to
# update a subset of the caches for when things do land on trunk. If that
# is deemed not worth it in the future, this can be simplify.

# NOTE: If making changes to most of the steps, please also look to update
# build.yml also.

        # Looking at https://hub.docker.com/_/swift, the version only tags (i.e.
        # - 5.9.2) can use different Ubuntu releases. But just to be safe we use
        # the specific OS release.
        #
        # We could use less specific tags (i.e. - 5.9), so they "float" as
        # new point release come, but to help make history/logs more clear,
        # being explicit (at the cost of having to update with point releases)
