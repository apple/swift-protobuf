Before opening a new issue, please double check the past issues (both open and
closed ones) to see if your problem has been discussed before and already
contains an answer/solution. Likewise, check the FAQ in the Documentation folder
for some common things -
  https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf/blob/master/Documentation/FAQ.md


Please be sure to include:

* what OS you are developing on (Linux or macOS, including the version)

* for macOS, what version of Xcode you are using (`xcodebuild -version`),
  for Linux, what version of Swift (`swift --version`)

* what version of Swift is your code set to compile with (i.e. from project
  settings, etc.)

* what branch/tag of SwiftProtobuf you are using (1.0.0, etc.)

* if you are getting compile errors, please be sure include all errors/warnings,
  sometimes the error before the one you are stuck on is important.

* lastly, if it all possible, provide a snippet of `.proto` and/or source
  that shows the problem.

Thank you!
