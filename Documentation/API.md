This is a description of how you can use the code generated by the plugin.

Apart from the actual properties themselves, most of this is not explicit in the
generated code.  Rather, most of this appears in common shared protocols in the
runtime library.  They're collected here to present a single document for how
you can use the generated code.

## Message API

Messages in the input proto file generate Swift structs in the result.  These
structs conform to `ProtobufMessage` and provide Swift properties for every
field, basic information about the message, standard initializers, and
serialization and deserialization methods.

Here is a simple proto3 input file to motivate the example below:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
message Example {
   enum E {
      DEFAULT = 0;
   }
   int32 field1 = 1;
   repeated string field2 = 2;
}
```

Here is the API for the struct generated from the above.  Note that this
includes a lot of methods that come from various protocols and omits some parts
of the generated code that are intended purely for internal use by the library:

```swift
public struct Example: ProtobufMessage {
  // The generated struct carries constant properties reflecting
  // basic information about the message:
  public var protoMessageName: String {return "Example"}
  public var protoPackageName: String {return ""}
  public var jsonFieldNames: [String: Int] {return ["field": 1]}
  public var protoFieldNames: [String: Int] {return ["field": 1]}

  // Nested enum and message types are nested in the generated Swift
  public enum E: ProtobufEnum { ... }

  // A public property is created for each field in the proto.
  public var field1: Int32 { get set }
  public var field2: [String] { get set }

  // Default Initializer
  public init()

  // A convenience initializer is constructed that has an
  // argument for every field.  This simplifies constructing
  // complex constant objects.
  public init(field1: Int32? = nil, field2: [String] = [])

  // Messages can be serialized or deserialized to Data objects
  // using protobuf binary format.
  // The extension set methods are only for proto2 extensible messages;
  // see below for more details.
  func serializeProtobuf() throws -> Data
  init(protobuf: Data) throws {
  init(protobuf: Data, extensions: ProtobufExtensionSet? = nil) throws

  // Messages can be serialized or deserialized to String objects
  // using JSON format.
  // See below for discussion of extension sets.
  func serializeJSON() throws -> String
  init(json: String) throws
  init(json: String, extensions: ProtobufExtensionSet) throws

  public var debugDescription: String
  public var hashValue: Int

  // The == operator below is implemented in terms of this method
  // so that you can easily override the implementation.
  // You should not call this method directly.
  public var isEqual(other: Example) -> Bool

  // These are the core methods used by all serialization and
  // deserialization mechanisms.
  public func decodeField(setter: inout ProtobufFieldDecoder, protoFieldNumber: Int) throws -> Bool
  public func traverse(visitor: inout ProtobufVisitor) throws
}

func ==(lhs: Example, rhs: Example) -> Bool
```

### Overridable Message methods

The following methods can be defined in manually-constructed extensions if you
want to override the generated behavior for any reason:

```swift
   // These are standard properties.
   public var debugDescription: String
   public var hashValue: Int

   // These are heavily used by the protobuf libraries but are rarely
   // used directly in normal code.
   public func isEqualTo(other: Example) -> Bool
   public mutating func decodeField(setter: inout ProtobufFieldDecoder, protoFieldNumber: Int) throws -> Bool
   public func traverse(visitor: inout ProtobufVisitor) throws
```

To allow the above to be easily overridden, they are all defined in the
`ProtobufGeneratedMessage` protocol.  The generated code provides standard
implementations of the core capabilities under different names; you can use
these when overriding the above methods, but we strongly advise you not to call
these directly from your own code except in such overrides:

```swift
public extension Example: ProtobufGeneratedMessage {
  public mutating fund _protoc_generated_decodeField(setter: inout ProtobufFieldDecoder, protoFieldNumber: Int) throws -> Bool
  public func _protoc_generated_traverse(visitor: inout ProtobufVisitor) throws
  public var _protoc_generated_isEqualTo(other: Example) -> Bool
}
```

## Enum API

Proto enums are translated to Swift enums in a fairly straightforward manner.
The resulting Swift enums conform to the `ProtobufEnum` protocol which extends
`RawRepresentable` with a `RawValue` of `Int`.

Proto2 enums simply have a case for each enum value.  If deserialization
encounters an unknown value, that value is either ignored (JSON) or handled as
an unknown field (protobuf binary), depending on the particular serialization.

Proto3 enums have an additional `UNRECOGNIZED(Int)` case that is used whenever
an unrecognized value is parsed from protobuf serialization or from other
serializations that store integer enum values.  JSON serialization with named
enum values drops unrecognize names.

```swift
public enum MyEnum: ProtobufEnum {
    public typealias RawValue = Int

    // Case for each value
    // Names are translated to a lowerCamelCase convention from
    // the UPPER_CASE convention in the proto file:
    case default
    case other
    case andMore
    case UNRECOGNIZED(Int) // Only in proto3 enums

    // Initializer selects the default value (see proto2 and proto3
    // language guides for details.
    public init()

    public init?(rawValue: Int)
    public init?(name: String)
    // Select the enum case based on JSON serialized name.
    // (See proto3 JSON serialization specification for details)
    public init?(jsonName: String)
    // Select the enum case matching the provide name, as
    // specified in the proto file.
    public init?(protoName: String)
    public var rawValue: Int
    // Return the full JSON coding for the current value.
    // This is normally a quoted string, but
    // UNRECOGNIZED(Int) returns a JSON number.
    public var json: String
    public var hashValue: Int
    public var debugDescription: String
}
```

## Mapping proto field types to Swift types

Types in the proto file are mapped to Swift types as follows:

### Basic types

| Proto type                |  Swift Type        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| int32                     | Int32              |
| sint32                    | Int32              |
| sfixed32                  | Int32              |
| uint32                    | UInt32             |
| fixed32                   | UInt32             |
| int64                     | Int64              |
| sint64                    | Int64              |
| sfixed64                  | Int64              |
| uint64                    | UInt64             |
| fixed64                   | UInt64             |
| bool                      | Bool               |
| float                     | Float              |
| double                    | Double             |
| string                    | String             |
| bytes                     | Data               |

### Generated Types

Enums in the proto file generate Int-valued enums in the Swift code.

Groups in the proto file generate Swift structs that conform to ProtobufGroup.

Messages in the proto file generate Swift structs that conform to
ProtobufMessage.

Note:  There is a `ProtobufGeneratedMessage` protocol.  You should not refer to
that directly; use `ProtobufMessage` when you need to work with arbitrary groups
or messages.

### Type modifiers

**Proto3 singular fields** generate properties of the corresponding type above.
These properties are initialized to the appropriate default value as specified
in the proto3 documentation:

* Numeric fields are initialized to zero.
* Boolean fields are initialize to false.
* String fields are initialized to the empty string.
* Bytes fields are initialized to an empty Data() object.
* Enum fields are initialized to the default value (the value corresponding to
  zero, which must be the first item in the enum).
* Message fields are initialized to an empty message of the appropriate type.

Notes: For performance, the field may be initialized lazily, but this is
invisible to the user.  The property will be serialized if it has a non-default
value.

**Proto2 `optional` fields without default values** generate properties whose
type is `Optional<T>` for the corresponding T as listed above.  The initial
value is nil.  You can set the value to nil to erase it.

**Proto2 `optional` fields with default values** work the same way but when
read, `nil` values are converted to the default value.  In particular, setting
the value to nil restores the default.  Optional fields are serialized unless
the internal value is nil, so setting an optional field explicitly to the
default value will cause it to be serialized.

**Proto2 `required` fields** TODO

### Compound types

**Proto `repeated` fields** generate simple properties of type `Array<T>` where
T is the base type from above.  Repeated fields are always initialized to empty.

**Proto `map` fields** generate simple properties of type `Dictionary<T,U>`
where T and U are the respective key and value types from above.  Map fields
are always initialized to an empty map.

### Oneof fields

Oneof fields generate an enum with a case for each associated field plus a
separate `None` case.  These enums conform to `ProtobufOneofEnum`.  Every case
except for the `None` case has an associated value corresponding to the declared
field.

In addition to the enum itself, the message will contain a read/write property
named after the enum which contains the enum value and a separate read/write
computed property for each member field of the enum.

### Groups

Groups act exactly like messages in all respects, except that they cannot be
directly serialized on their own and they conform to the `ProtobufGroup`
protocol instead of `ProtobufMessage`.

## Well-Known Types

For most of the proto3 well-known types, the Swift API is exactly what you would
expect from the corresponding proto definitions.  (In fact, the runtime library
version for most of these is simply generated.)  The variations are described
below.

| Proto Type                  |  Swift Type               |
| -------------------------   | -----------------------   |
| google.protobuf.Any         | Google_Protobuf_Any         |
| google.protobuf.Api         | Google_Protobuf_Api         |
| google.protobuf.BoolValue   | Google_Protobuf_BoolValue   |
| google.protobuf.BytesValue  | Google_Protobuf_BytesValue  |
| google.protobuf.DoubleValue | Google_Protobuf_DoubleValue |
| google.protobuf.Duration    | Google_Protobuf_Duration    |
| google.protobuf.Empty       | Google_Protobuf_Empty       |
| google.protobuf.FieldMask   | Google_Protobuf_FieldMask   |
| google.protobuf.FloatValue  | Google_Protobuf_FloatValue  |
| google.protobuf.Int64Value  | Google_Protobuf_Int64Value  |
| google.protobuf.ListValue   | Google_Protobuf_ListValue   |
| google.protobuf.StringValue | Google_Protobuf_StringValue |
| google.protobuf.Struct      | Google_Protobuf_Struct      |
| google.protobuf.Timestamp   | Google_Protobuf_Timestamp   |
| google.protobuf.Type        | Google_Protobuf_Type        |
| google.protobuf.UInt32Value | Google_Protobuf_UInt32Value |
| google.protobuf.UInt64Value | Google_Protobuf_UInt64Value |
| google.protobuf.Value       | Google_Protobuf_Value       |


### Google_Protobuf_Any

The Any JSON representation is treated essentially as a separate serialization
format.  Each message has

```
  TODO
```

### Google_Protobuf_BoolValue, Google_Protobuf_BytesValue, etc.

These are customized to produce the expected JSON and Any JSON forms, but are
otherwise exactly as you would expect.

### Google_Protobuf_Duration, Google_Protobuf_Timestamp

The `Google_Protobuf_Duration` and `Google_Protobuf_Timestamp` structs have
customized JSON and Any JSON handling to match Google's specification.  In
particular, JSON serialization will throw an error if the duration is greater
than 315576000000 seconds or if the timestamp is before `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`
or after `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z` Gregorian proleptic.

The `Google_Protobuf_Duration` type also conforms to
`ExpressibleByFloatLiteral`; it can be initialized with a double representing
the number of seconds.

There are also overrides for simple arithmetic with durations and timestamps:

```swift
func -(lhs: Google_Protobuf_Timestamp, rhs: Google_Protobuf_Timestamp) -> Google_Protobuf_Duration
func -(lhs: Google_Protobuf_Duration, rhs: Google_Protobuf_Duration) -> Google_Protobuf_Duration
public func +(lhs: Google_Protobuf_Duration, rhs: Google_Protobuf_Duration) -> Google_Protobuf_Duration
public func -(operand: Google_Protobuf_Duration) -> Google_Protobuf_Duration
public func -(lhs: Google_Protobuf_Timestamp, rhs: Google_Protobuf_Duration) -> Google_Protobuf_Timestamp
public func +(lhs: Google_Protobuf_Timestamp, rhs: Google_Protobuf_Duration) -> Google_Protobuf_Timestamp
```

### Google_Protobuf_Value, Google_Protobuf_Struct, Google_Protobuf_ArrayValue

`Google_Protobuf_NullValue` is a simple single-value enum.

As expected, `Google_Protobuf_Struct` contains a single `fields` dictionary
mapping strings to `Google_Protobuf_Value` objects.  It also conforms to
`ExpressibleByDictionaryLiteral` and provides a `subscript` for directly
accessing the values by name.

The `Google_Protobuf_Value` type implements the expected oneof semantics, with
a separate property for each type of contained object.

## Extensions

Extensions are used to add additional properties to messages defined elsewhere.
They are fully supported in proto2 files.  They are supported in proto3 only
when extending the standard Descriptor type.  These are defined in proto files
as follows:

```protobuf
/// File sample.proto
syntax="proto2";
message CanBeExtended {
   extensions 100 to 200;
}

extend CanBeExtended {
   optional int32 extensionField = 100;
}
```

There are several pieces to the extension support:

 * **Extensible Messages** (such as `CanBeExtended` above) conform to
   `ProtobufExtensibleMessage` and define some additional methods needed by the
   other components.  You should not use these methods directly.
 * **Extension properties** use Swift `extension` to add new properties to the
   original message.  In many cases, you can simply use the extension properties
   without understanding any of the other extension machinery.  The above
   example creates a Swift extension of `CanBeExtended` that defines a new
   property `extensionField` of type `Optional<Int32>`.
 * **Extension objects** are opaque objects that define the extension itself,
   including storage and serialization details.  Because proto allows extension
   names to be reused, these objects appear in the context corresponding to the
   context where the proto extension was defined, which generally does not
   correspond to that of the message being extended.  In the above example, the
   extension object would be `CanBeExtended_extensionField` at the file scope.
 * **Extension sets** are collections of extension objects.  An extension set is
   generated by the code generator and included as a static global variable in
   every Swift source file generated from a proto file that defines extensions.
   Extension sets are provided to the deserialization APIs to define what
   extension fields the decoder should recognize.  In the above example, the
   generated extension set would be `Sample_Extensions`.

```swift
/// ProtobufExtensionSet implements a subset of the Set API.
public struct ProtobufExtensionSet: ExpressibleByArrayLiteral {
    public typealias Element = ProtobufMessageExtension
    public init()
    init(arrayLiteral: Element...)
    public subscript(messageType: ProtobufMessage.Type, protoFieldNumber: Int) -> ProtobufMessageExtension?
    public func fieldNumberForJson(messageType: ProtobufJSONMessageBase.Type, jsonFieldName: String) -> Int?
    public mutating func insert(_: Element)
    public mutating func insert(contentsOf: [Element])
    public mutating func union(_: ProtobufExtensionSet) -> ProtobufExtensionSet
}
```

# Generated Code Reference

The following describes how each construct in a `.proto` file gets translated
into Swift language constructs:

**Files:** Each input `.proto` file generates a single output file with the
`.proto` extension replaced with `.pb.swift`.

**Messages:** Each input message generates a single output struct that conforms
to the `ProtobufMessageType` protocol.  Small leaf messages (those that don't
have message-typed fields) generate simple structs.  Non-leaf messages use a
private copy-on-write backing class to provide full value semantics while also
supporting recursive data structures.  Nested messages generate nested struct
types so that

```protobuf
package quux;
message Foo {
   message Bar {
      int32 baz = 1;
   }
   Bar bar = 1;
}
```

will be compiled to a structure like the following

```swift
public struct QuuxFoo {
    // ...
    public struct Bar {
        // ...
        var baz: Int32 {get set}
        // ...
    }
    var bar: Bar {get set}
    // ...
}
```

which you can use as follows:

```swift
   var foo = QuuxFoo()
   foo.bar.baz = 77
```

**Groups:** Each group within a message generates a nested struct.  The group
struct implements the `ProtobufGroupType` protocol which differs from
`ProtobufMessageType` primarily in how it handles serialization and
deserialization (you do not normally need to be aware of this).  Note that
groups are deprecated and only available with the older 'proto2' language
dialect.

**Binary Serialization and Deserialization:**  You can serialize to a `Data`
using the `serializeProtobuf()` method or deserialize with the corresponding
initializer:

```swift
init(protobuf: Data) throws
func serializeProtobuf() throws -> Data
```

Protobuf binary serialization can currently only fail if the data includes Any
fields that were decoded from JSON format.  See below for details.

Unrecognized fields are preserved through decoding/encoding cycles for proto2
messages.  Unrecognized fields are dropped for proto3 messages.

**JSON Serialization and Deserialization:**  Similarly, JSON serialization is
handled by `serializeJSON()` which returns a `String` with the result.
Deserialization is handled by the corresponding initializer:

```swift
init(json: String) throws
func serializeJSON() throws -> String
```

JSON serialization can fail if there are Any fields that were decoded from
binary protobuf format, or if you abuse the well-known Timestamp, Duration, or
FieldMask types.

**Other Message Features:** All messages conform to `Hashable`, `Equatable`,
and `CustomDebugStringConvertible`.

**Convenience Initializer:** Messages that have fields gain an additional
convenience intializer that has an argument for every field.  The arguments are
defaulted so you can specify only the ones you actually need to set.

**Fields:**  Each field is compiled into a property on the struct.  Field names
are converted from `snake_case` conventions in the proto file to
`lowerCamelCase` property names in the Swift file.  If the result conflicts with
a reserved word, an underscore will be appended to the property name.

**Optional Fields:**  Optional fields generate Swift Optional properties. Such
properties have a default value of `nil` unless overridden in the .proto file.
You can assign `nil` to any such property to reset it to the default.  For
optional fields without a default, you can test whether the field is `nil` to
see if it has been set.  There is currently no way to test if optional fields
that do have defaults have been set.

When serializing an optional field, the field is serialized if it has been set
to a non-nil value.  In particular, fields with defaults are not serialized if
they have been reset by writing 'nil' but are serialized if you explicitly set
them to the default value.

**Required Fields:**  Required fields generate non-Optional properties.  All
such properties return suitable default values when read.  If no default value
is specified in the .proto, numeric fields default to zero, boolean fields
default to false, string fields default to the empty string, byte fields default
to the empty array, enum fields default to the appropriate default enum value,
and message fields default to an empty object of that type.  Currently, required
fields are always serialized, even if they have not been changed from their
default.  This may change.

**Repeated Fields:** Repeated fields generate array-valued properties. All such
properties default to an empty array.

**Map:** Map fields generate Dictionary-valued properties. When read, these
properties default to an empty dictionary.  The dictionary values can be mutated
directly.

**Proto3 Singular Fields:**  Proto3 does not support required or optional fields.
Singular proto3 fields generate non-optional Swift properties.  These fields are
initialized to the appropriate Proto3 default value (zero for numeric fields,
false for booleans, etc.)  They are serialized if they have a non-default value.

**Proto3 Singular message Fields:**  Proto3 singular message fields behave
externally as other singular fields.  In particular, reading such a field
returns a valid empty message object by default.  Internally, however, singular
message fields are in fact stored as Swift optionals, but this is only done as
an optimization and is not visible to clients.

**Enums:** Each enum in the proto file generates a Swift enum that implements
RawRepresentable with a base type of Int. The enum is nested within an enclosing
message, if any. The enum contains the specified cases from the source .proto
plus an extra `UNRECOGNIZED(Int)` case that is used to carry unknown enum values
when decoding binary protobuf format.  Enums with duplicate cases (more than one
case with the same integer value) are fully supported.

**Oneof:** Each oneof field generates an enum with a case for each field in the
oneof block. The containing message provides an accessor for the oneof field
itself that allows you to set or get the enum value directly and allows you to
use a `switch` or `if case` statement to conditionally handle the contents. The
containing message also provides shortcut accessors for each field in the oneof
that will return the corresponding value if present or `nil` if that value is
not present.

**Reflection:**  The standard Swift Mirror() facility can be used to inspect the
fields on generated messages.  Fields appear in the reflection if they would be
serialized.  In particular, proto2 required fields are always included, proto2
optional fields are included if they are non-nil, and proto3 singular fields are
included if they do not have a default value.

**Extensions:**  Each extension in a proto file generates two distinct
components:

* An extension object that defines the type, field number, and other properties
  of the extension.  This is defined at a scope corresponding to where the proto
  extension was defined.
* A Swift extension of the message struct that provides natural property access
  for the extension value on that message struct.

Each generated Swift file that defines extensions also has a static constant
holding a ProtobufExtensionSet with all extensions declared in that file.

To decode a message with extensions, you need to first obtain or construct a
ProtobufExtensionSet holding extension objects for all of the extensions you
want to support.  A single ProtobufExtensionSet can hold any number of
extensions for any number of messages.  You then provide this set to the
deserializing initializer which will use it to identify and deserialize
extension fields.

You need do nothing special to have extension values properly serialized.

To set or read extension properties, you simply use the standard property
access.

Caveat:  Extensions are not available in proto3.

**Any:**  The Any message type is included in the runtime package as
`Google_Protobuf_Any`.  You can construct a message from a `Google_Protobuf_Any`
value via a convenience initializer available on any ProtobufMessageType:
`init?(any: Google_Protobuf_Any)`.  You can similarly construct a
`Google_Protobuf_Any` object from any message using
`Google_Protobuf_Any(message: ProtobufMessageType)`.  To support this, each
generated message includes a property `anyTypeURL` containing the URL for that
message type.  This URL is included in the Any object when one is constructed
from a message, and is checked when constructing a message from an Any.
Caveat:  Although Any fields can be encoded in both binary protobuf and JSON,
Google's spec places limits on translations between these two codings.  As a
result, you should be careful with Any fields if you expect to use both JSON and
protobuf encodings.

**Well-known types:**  Google has defined a number of "well-known types" as
part of proto3.  These are predefined messages that support common idioms.
These well-known types are precompiled and bundled into the Swift runtime:

| Proto Type                  |  Swift Type               |
| -------------------------   | -----------------------   |
| google.protobuf.Any         | Google_Protobuf_Any         |
| google.protobuf.Api         | Google_Protobuf_Api         |
| google.protobuf.BoolValue   | Google_Protobuf_BoolValue   |
| google.protobuf.BytesValue  | Google_Protobuf_BytesValue  |
| google.protobuf.DoubleValue | Google_Protobuf_DoubleValue |
| google.protobuf.Duration    | Google_Protobuf_Duration    |
| google.protobuf.Empty       | Google_Protobuf_Empty       |
| google.protobuf.FieldMask   | Google_Protobuf_FieldMask   |
| google.protobuf.FloatValue  | Google_Protobuf_FloatValue  |
| google.protobuf.Int64Value  | Google_Protobuf_Int64Value  |
| google.protobuf.ListValue   | Google_Protobuf_ListValue   |
| google.protobuf.StringValue | Google_Protobuf_StringValue |
| google.protobuf.Struct      | Google_Protobuf_Struct      |
| google.protobuf.Timestamp   | Google_Protobuf_Timestamp   |
| google.protobuf.Type        | Google_Protobuf_Type        |
| google.protobuf.UInt32Value | Google_Protobuf_UInt32Value |
| google.protobuf.UInt64Value | Google_Protobuf_UInt64Value |
| google.protobuf.Value       | Google_Protobuf_Value       |


To use the well-known types in your own protos, you will need to have the
corresponding protos available so you can `import` them into your proto file.
However, the compiled forms of these types are already available in the library;
you do not need to compile them or do anything to use them other than
`import Protobuf`.

## Aside:  proto2 vs. proto3

The terms *proto2* and *proto3* refer to two different dialects of the proto
*language.*  The older proto2 language dates back to 2008, the proto3 language
was introduced in 2015.  These should not be confused with versions of the
protobuf *project* or the protoc *program*.  In particular, the protoc 3.0
program has solid support for both proto2 and proto3 language dialects.  Many
people continue to use the proto2 language with protoc 3.0 because they have
existing systems that depend on particular features of the proto2 language that
were changed in proto3.
