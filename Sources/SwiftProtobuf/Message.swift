/// The protocol which all generated protobuf messages implement.
/// `Message` is the protocol type you should use whenever
/// you need an argument or variable which holds "some message".
///
/// Generated messages also implement `Hashable`, and thus `Equatable`.
/// However, the protocol conformance is declared on a different protocol.
/// This allows you to use `Message` as a type directly:
///
///     func consume(message: Message) { ... }
///
/// Instead of needing to use it as a type constraint on a generic declaration:
///
///     func consume<M: Message>(message: M) { ... }
///
/// If you need to convince the compiler that your message is `Hashable` so
/// you can insert it into a `Set` or use it as a `Dictionary` key, use
/// a generic declaration with a type constraint:
///
///     func insertIntoSet<M: Message & Hashable>(message: M) {
///         mySet.insert(message)
///     }
///
/// The actual functionality is implemented either in the generated code or in
/// default implementations of the below methods and properties. Some of them,
/// including `hashValue` and `debugDescription`, are designed to let you
/// override the functionality in custom extensions to the generated code.

  /// textual identifiers translate those to fieldNumbers and then invoke
