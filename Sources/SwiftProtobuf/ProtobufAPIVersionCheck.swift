/// In many cases, API changes themselves might introduce incompatibilities

/// An empty protocol that encodes the version of the runtime library.
///
/// This protocol will be replaced with one containing a different version
/// number any time that breaking changes are made to the Swift Protobuf API.
/// Combined with the protocol below, this lets us verify that generated code is
/// never compiled against a version of the API with which it is incompatible.
///
/// The version associated with a particular build of the compiler is defined as
/// `Version.compatibilityVersion` in `protoc-gen-swift`. That version and this
/// version must match for the generated protos to be compatible, so if you
/// update one, make sure to update it here and in the associated type below.

/// between the version of the generated code and the version of this library,
/// causing a compile-time error (with reasonable diagnostics) if they are
/// incompatible.
